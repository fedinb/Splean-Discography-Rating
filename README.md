# Splean Discography Rating

Splean is a popular Russian rock band, formed in Saint Petersburg in 1994. Since then, they have remained one of the most popular rock bands in Russia and the former Soviet Union. The band's name is derived from "spleen" (in the sense of "depression"), and the "ea" spelling in English is a pun on the spelling of the Beatles. It was borrowed from a short poem by Sasha Cherny, which the band set to music. **<-- Wikipedia**

Splean is my favorite Russian rock band and I don't remember why, but I decided to rate all of its 17 (by January'21) studio albums.

## Calculation

Raw data is stored in Excel. At first I tried to make it in JSON, but its format (in my specific case) wasn't the most suitable one for further processing.

Rating calculation follows this simple logic: if album has 10 songs and I like 5 of them, rating makes up 50%. With this calculation approach I can only get my favorite album, but it doesn't mean that my favorite song is included in Top-1 album.

You can find the script with rating table and line chart in .ipynb file attached.
