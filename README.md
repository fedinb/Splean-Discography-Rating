# Splean Discography Rating

Splean is a popular Russian rock band, formed in Saint Petersburg in 1994. Since then, they have remained one of the most popular rock bands in Russia and the former Soviet Union. The band's name is derived from "spleen" (in the sense of "depression"), and the "ea" spelling in English is a pun on the spelling of the Beatles. It was borrowed from a short poem by Sasha Cherny, which the band set to music. **<-- Wikipedia**

Splean is my favorite Russian rock band and I don't remember why, but I decided to rate all of its 17 (by January'21) studio albums.
